dot-files
=========
Intro
-----

The dot-files repository allows you to persist your standard vim configuration across multiple machines.

It is currently only tested on Windows, but I would be happy to incorporate any changes needed to get it working reliably on a *nix host.

Depends on Vundle and therefore git.
